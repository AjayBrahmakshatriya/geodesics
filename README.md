# A code generator for stencil computations over spheres (WIP)

This project aims to create a code generator that generates code to perform stencil computations over spheres in an efficient manner. It uses the AlphaZ equational programming language ([link](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/AlphaZ/wiki/doku.php)) for the final C code generation. The AlphaZ code itself is generated by a Python script, which takes a stencil specification as an input. Multiple channels of various data types are supported (eg. there can be a temperature and a pressure channel, with the stencil using values from both channels). This project will be particularly useful for geodesic stencil calculations, such as those for weather simulation.
